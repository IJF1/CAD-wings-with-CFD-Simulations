# CAD-wings-with-CFD-Simulations


This repo contains two CAD models designed as part of my engineering learning and portfolio building.  
Both projects demonstrate mechanical design, CAD proficiency, and engineering thinking linked directly to motorsport applications.

## 📂 Projects

1. **Suspension Component Prototype** (`Untitled.stl`)  
   - Designed to explore load-bearing structures under race conditions  
   - Focused on optimizing weight distribution while maintaining rigidity  
   - Considered aerodynamic smoothness and manufacturability  
   - Exported as `.stl` for 3D printing and FEA simulations  

2. **Aerodynamic Bodywork Element** (`Untitled (1).stl`)  
   - Inspired by F1 aero design principles (airflow channeling, drag reduction)  
   - Created to study surface curvature and mounting integration  
   - Geometry is suitable for CFD analysis to evaluate downforce/drag effects  
   - Shows understanding of parametric design in CAD tools

## 🔧 Tools & Workflow

- CAD Software: *[Insert your CAD tool here – e.g. SolidWorks, Fusion 360, CATIA]*  
- Exported to `.stl` for 3D printing and simulation compatibility  
- Iterative design approach: concept sketch → CAD modelling → refinement

## 🧠 Skills Demonstrated

- **CAD Modelling:**  
  Parametric modelling, assembly integration, and export for analysis  
- **Engineering Design:**  
  Structural consideration in suspension element  
  Aerodynamic shaping in aero bodywork  
- **Simulation Awareness:**  
  Designed with FEA/CFD analysis in mind  
  Understanding of material constraints and racing applications  
- **Motorsport Relevance:**  
  Direct link to chassis/suspension design and aero optimisation, both key in F1 engineering

## 📸 Visualisation

*Screenshots/renderings can be added here once exported from CAD:*  
- Suspension component render  
- Aero element render  

*(Recommended: add a quick render in Fusion 360 or SolidWorks for visual impact.)*

## 🎯 Future Development

- Perform FEA on the suspension component for stress/strain under load  
- Run CFD simulations on the aero bodywork to measure drag/downforce  
- Integrate both components into a larger F1-inspired assembly model
