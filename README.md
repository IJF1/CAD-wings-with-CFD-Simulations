# CAD-wings-with-CFD-Simulations


This repo contains two 3D CAD models I created to explore aerodynamics and structural design in motorsport contexts. Both models were developed with F1-style concepts in mind, focusing on airflow management, downforce generation, and manufacturability.

## Projects

1. **Rear wing(old spec)** 
   - Multi-element aerofoil structure. 
   - Designed to investigate airflow of the old rear wings(2010 era)
   - Considered aerodynamic smoothness and manufacturability  
   
2. **Rear wing(new spec-2022)**
   - Curved profile structure with integrated mounting base.  
   - Side plates feature cut-outs for drag reduction and directing vortices.
   - Geometry is suitable for CFD analysis to evaluate downforce/drag effects  
   - Shows understanding of CAD tools

## Tools 

- CAD Software: Used Sektchup and Airshaper for CFD simulations 
- Exported to `.stl` for 3D printing and simulation compatibility  

---

## Skills Demonstrated

- **CAD Modelling:**  
  Surface and solid modelling, assemblies, and export for analysis.  
- **Engineering Design:**  
  Structural consideration in suspension element  
  Aerodynamic shaping in aero bodywork  
- **Simulation Awareness:**  
  Designed with CFD analysis in mind  
  Understanding of racing applications  
- **Motorsport Relevance:**  
  Direct link to chassis/suspension design and aero optimisation, both key in F1 engineering

## ðŸ“¸ Visualisation

*Screenshots/renderings can be added here once exported from CAD:*  
- Suspension component render  
- Aero element render  

*(Recommended: add a quick render in Fusion 360 or SolidWorks for visual impact.)*

---

## Future Development
 
- Run CFD simulations on the aero bodywork to measure drag/downforce from "dirty air".
- Integrate both components into a larger F1-inspired assembly model
